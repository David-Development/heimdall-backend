# Heimdall 
Face recognition prototype with webinterface. Created for the Masterthesis "Neuronale Netze und andere Verfahren zur 
Gesichtserkennung im Heimautomatisierungsfumeld" by Constantin Kirsch for the Master of Science in Computer Science at 
the Bonn-Rhine-Sieg University. Created at the [Multimedia Communication Laboratory](http://mc-lab.inf.h-brs.de/). 
It uses the powerful face recognition model from the [Dlib](https://github.com/davisking/dlib)-library by Davis King, 
as well as the Histogram of Oriented Gradients face detection model. Classification is done with a SVM classifier from 
[Scikit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/). The face detection, feature extraction and training is embedded into a 
[Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) based Webapplication. The whole application is considered as a prototype for 
experimentation. More Information can be found in the thesis itself or a technical report as soon as they are available
(Finished writing and made public).
